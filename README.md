With Stuur, you can send send messages to random people and receive messages from random people. Each message you send will go to a different random person, and each message you receive was sent from a different random person.

There are three messaging pools: Friends, Local, and Global. In each group, you send and receive randomly within the group. Global contains everyone with the app, and Local contains everyone within approximately 10 miles of your location. In the Friends group, you receive messages from people you add as friends and send messages to people who have added you as a friend.

We do not control or monitor what users say, but Stuur detects profanity from your received messages. You can change your censor options in the settings screen.
